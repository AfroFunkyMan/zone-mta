# DKIM keys folder for default keys

Place DKIM signing keys here if you want to use the example API for retrieving user configuration. If you need to store DKIM keys in some other folder, change the folder path in the config file. If you want to handle your own key management then you do not need to use this folder for anything.

Key name format: {domain}.{selector}.pem

For example:

- Domain name: _müriaad-polüteism.info_
- Key selector: _myselector_
- File name: _xn--mriaad-polteism-zvbj.info.myselector.pem_
